Two families of models are considered: the first corresponds to a system of interacting diffusions whereas the second describes a collection of pure jump Markov processes with a countable state space. For both cases the moderate deviation principle is formulated in terms of a large deviation principle (LDP), with an appropriate speed function, for suitably centered and normalized empirical measure processes. For the first family of models the LDP is established in the path space of an appropriate Schwartz distribution space whereas for the second family the LDP is proved in the space of {\$}l{\_}2{\$} (the Hilbert space of square summable sequences)-valued paths. Proofs rely on certain variational representations for exponential functionals of Brownian motions and Poisson random measures.},

The sequential prototype is the n-fold way algorithm [2], which is efficient but is hard to parallelize using conservative methods. Our parallel algorithm is optimistic. Unlike other optimistic algorithms, e.g., Time Warp, our algorithm is synchronous. It also belongs to the class of simulations known as "relaxation" [3]; hence it is named "synchronous relaxation." We derive performance guarantees for this algorithm. If N is the number of PEs, then under weak assumptions we show that the number of correct events processed per unit of time is, on average, at least of order N/logN.

abstract = {We consider a variation of the supermarket model in which the servers can communicate with their neighbors and where the neighborhood relationships are described in terms of a suitable graph. Tasks with unit-exponential service time distributions arrive at each vertex as independent Poisson processes with rate {\$}\backslashlambda{\$}, and each task is irrevocably assigned to the shortest queue among the one it first appears and its {\$}d-1{\$} randomly selected neighbors. This model has been extensively studied when the underlying graph is a clique in which case it reduces to the well known power-of-{\$}d{\$} scheme. In particular, results of Mitzenmacher (1996) and Vvedenskaya et al. (1996) show that as the size of the clique gets large, the occupancy process associated with the queue-lengths at the various servers converges to a deterministic limit described by an infinite system of ordinary differential equations (ODE). In this work, we consider settings where the underlying graph need not be a clique and is allowed to be suitably sparse. We show that if the minimum degree approaches infinity (however slowly) as the number of servers {\$}N{\$} approaches infinity, and the ratio between the maximum degree and the minimum degree in each connected component approaches 1 uniformly, the occupancy process converges to the same system of ODE as the classical supermarket model. In particular, the asymptotic behavior of the occupancy process is insensitive to the precise network topology. We also study the case where the graph sequence is random, with the {\$}N{\$}-th graph given as an Erd$\backslash$H{\{}o{\}}s-R$\backslash$'enyi random graph on {\$}N{\$} vertices with average degree {\$}c(N){\$}. Annealed convergence of the occupancy process to the same deterministic limit is established under the condition {\$}c(N)\backslashto\backslashinfty{\$}, and under a stronger condition {\$}c(N)/\backslashln N\backslashto\backslashinfty{\$}, convergence (in probability) is shown for almost every realization of the random graph.},

In our model, energy storage devices are incorporated for not only inter-temporal energy arbitrage to reduce total generation cost, but also providing spinning reserve to share generators' burden. To solve this problem, we assume that the communication networks are strongly connected directed graphs and propose a fully distributed algorithm based on the ‘consensus-like' iterative algorithm and the alternating direction method of multipliers. Our algorithm is distributed in the sense that no leader or master nodes are needed, while all the nodes conduct local computation and communicate merely with their neighbours. Numerical simulation is included to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {The mean field limits of systems of interacting diffusions (also called stochastic interacting particle systems (SIPS)) have been intensively studied since McKean $\backslash$cite{\{}mckean1966class{\}}. The interacting diffusions pave a way to probabilistic representations for many important nonlinear/nonlocal PDEs, but provide a great challenge for Monte Carlo simulations. This is due to the nonlinear dependence of the bias on the statistical error arising through the approximation of the law of the process. This and the fact that particles/diffusions are not independent render classical variance reduction techniques not directly applicable and consequently make simulations of interacting diffusions prohibitive. In this article, we provide an alternative iterative particle representation, inspired by the fixed point argument by Sznitman $\backslash$cite{\{}sznitman1991topics{\}}. This new representation has the same mean field limit as the classical SIPS. However, unlike classical SIPS, it also allows decomposing the statistical error and the approximation bias. We develop a general framework to study integrability and regularity properties of the iterated particle system. Moreover, we establish its weak convergence to the McKean-Vlasov SDEs (MVSDEs). One of the immediate advantages of iterative particle system is that it can be combined with the Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) approach for the simulation of MVSDEs. We proved that the MLMC approach reduces the computational complexity of calculating expectations by an order of magnitude. Another perspective on this work is that we analyse the error of nested Multilevel Monte Carlo estimators, which is of independent interest. Furthermore, we work with state dependent functionals, unlike scalar outputs which are common in literature on MLMC. The error analysis is carried out in uniform, and what seems to be new, weighted norms.},

abstract = {In model networks of E-cells and I-cells (excitatory and inhibitory neurons, respectively), synchronous rhythmic spiking often comes about from the interplay between the two cell groups: the E-cells synchronize the I-cells and vice versa. Under ideal conditions-homogeneity in relevant network parameters and all-to-all connectivity, for instance-this mechanism can yield perfect synchronization. We find that approximate, imperfect synchronization is possible even with very sparse, random connectivity. The crucial quantity is the expected number of inputs per cell. As long as it is large enough (more precisely, as long as the variance of the total number of synaptic inputs per cell is small enough), tight synchronization is possible. The desynchronizing effect of random connectivity can be reduced by strengthening the E --{\textgreater} I synapses. More surprising, it cannot be reduced by strengthening the I --{\textgreater} E synapses. However, the decay time constant of inhibition plays an important role. Faster decay yields tighter synchrony. In particular, in models in which the inhibitory synapses are assumed to be instantaneous, the effects of sparse, random connectivity cannot be seen.},

The neurons belong to a fixed number of populations and are represented either by the Hodgkin-Huxley model or by one of its simplified version, the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model. The synapses between neurons are either electrical or chemical. The network is assumed to be fully connected. The maximum conductances vary randomly. Under the condition that all neurons initial conditions are drawn independently from the same law that depends only on the population they belong to, we prove that a propagation of chaos phenomenon takes places, namely that in the mean-field limit, any finite number of neurons become independent and, within each population, have the same probability distribution. This probability distribution is solution of a set of implicit equations, either nonlinear stochastic differential equations resembling the McKean-Vlasov equations, or non-local partial differential equations resembling the McKean-Vlasov-Fokker- Planck equations. We prove the well-posedness of these equations, i.e. the existence and uniqueness of a solution. We also show the results of some preliminary numerical experiments that indicate that the mean-field equations are a good representation of the mean activity of a finite size network, even for modest sizes. These experiment also indicate that the McKean-Vlasov-Fokker- Planck equations may be a good way to understand the mean-field dynamics through, e.g., a bifurcation analysis.},

abstract = {The synaptic connectivity within neuronal networks is thought to determine the information processing they perform, yet network structure-function relationships remain poorly understood. By combining quantitative anatomy of the cerebellar input layer and information theoretic analysis of network models, we investigated how synaptic connectivity affects information transmission and processing. Simplified binary models revealed that the synaptic connectivity within feedforward networks determines the trade-off between information transmission and sparse encoding. Networks with few synaptic connections per neuron and network-activity-dependent threshold were optimal for lossless sparse encoding over the widest range of input activities. Biologically detailed spiking network models with experimentally constrained synaptic conductances and inhibition confirmed our analytical predictions. Our results establish that the synaptic connectivity within the cerebellar input layer enables efficient lossless sparse encoding. Moreover, they provide a functional explanation for why granule cells have approximately four dendrites, a feature that has been evolutionarily conserved since the appearance of fish. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The relating of deterministic, mean-field models into network models, where epidemic spread occurs between interconnected susceptible and infectious individuals or populations, requires careful consideration. Here, we discuss models that consider differently the manner in which contact rate and infectiousness change over time, with different algorithms suitable for different underlying processes. Though these models give coincidental results to the mean-field in the case of large, highly connected networks, the results when sparsely connected networks are considered may differ. Different subsets of the parameters from the mean-field epidemic (R0, generation time, infectiousness, etc.) are preserved in each case. Despite these differences, simulated epidemics generated under some model architectures are insensitive to the average degree of contact amongst nodes, k. Model-based estimates of k may be model dependent, and must therefore be viewed with caution. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Biophysical modeling of brain activity has a long and illustrious history (Ermentrout, 1998; Deco et al., 2008; Coombes, 2010) and has recently profited from technological advances that furnish neuroimaging data at an unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution (Giollory and Bujarski, 2014; Sporns, 2014). Neuronal modeling is a very active area of research, with applications ranging from the characterization of neurobiological and cognitive processes (Jirsa, 2004b,a; Bojak and Liley, 2005; Philipps and Robinson, 2009; Rolls and Treves, 2011) to constructing artificial brains in silico and building brain-machine interface and neuro-prosthetic devices, e.g. Einevoll et al., 2013; Whalen et al., 2013. Biophysical modeling has always benefited from interdisciplinary interactions between different and seemingly distant fields; ranging from mathematics and engineering to linguistics and psychology. This Research Topic aims to promote such interactions by promoting papers that contribute to a deeper understanding of neural activity as measured by fMRI or electrophysiology. In general, mean field models of neural activity can be divided into two classes: neural mass and neural field models. The main difference between these classes is that field models prescribe how a quantitiy characterizing neural activity (such as average depolarization of a neural population) evolves over both space and time as opposed to mass models, which characterize activity over time only; by assuming that all neurons in a population are located at (approximately) the same point. This Research Topic focusses on both classes of models and consideres several aspects and their relative merits that: span from synnapses to the whole briain; comparisons of their predictions with EEG and MEG spectra of spontaneous brain activity; evoked responses, seizures, and fitting data - to infer brain states and map physiological parameters.},

abstract = {Synchronization of an ensemble of oscillators is an emergent phenomenon present in several complex systems, ranging from social and physical to biological and technological systems. The most successful approach to describe how coherent behavior emerges in these complex systems is given by the paradigmatic Kuramoto model. This model has been traditionally studied in complete graphs. However, besides being intrinsically dynamical, complex systems present very heterogeneous structure, which can be represented as complex networks. This report is dedicated to review main contributions in the field of synchronization in networks of Kuramoto oscillators. In particular, we provide an overview of the impact of network patterns on the local and global dynamics of coupled phase oscillators. We cover many relevant topics, which encompass a description of the most used analytical approaches and the analysis of several numerical results. Furthermore, we discuss recent developments on variations of the Kuramoto model in networks, including the presence of noise and inertia. The rich potential for applications is discussed for special fields in engineering, neuroscience, physics and Earth science. Finally, we conclude by discussing problems that remain open after the last decade of intensive research on the Kuramoto model and point out some promising directions for future research.},

abstract = {Mean field game (MFG) theory generalizes classical models of interacting particle systems by replacing the particles with rational agents, making the theory more applicable in economics and other social sciences. Intuitively, (stochastic differential) MFGs are infinite-population or continuum limits of large-population stochastic differential games of a certain symmetric type, and a solution of an MFG is analogous to a Nash equilibrium. This thesis tackles several fundamental problems in MFG theory. First, if (approximate) equilibria exist in the large-population games, to what limits (if any) do they converge as the population size tends to infinity? Second, can the limiting system be used to construct approximate equilibria for the finite-population games? Finally, what can be said about existence and uniqueness of equilibria, for the finite- or infinite-population models? This thesis presents a complete picture of the limiting behavior of the large-population systems, both with and without common noise, under modest assumptions on the model inputs. Approximate Nash equilibria in the n-player games admit certain weak limits as n tends to infinity, and every limit is a weak solution of the MFG. Conversely, every weak MFG solution can be obtained as the limit of a sequence of approximate Nash equilibria in the n-player games. Even in the setting without common noise, a new solution concept is needed in order to capture all of the possible limits. Interestingly, and in contrast with well known results on related interacting particle systems, empirical state distributions often admit stochastic limits which are not simply randomizations among the deterministic solutions. With the limit theory in mind, the thesis then develops new existence and uniqueness results. Using controlled martingale problems together with relaxed controls, a general existence theorem is derived by means of Kakutani's fixed point theorem. In the common noise case, a natural notion of weak solution is introduced, and the existence and uniqueness theory is designed in perfect analogy with weak solutions of stochastic differential equations. An existence theorem for weak solutions is proven by a discretization procedure, and a Yamada-Watanabe result is presented and illustrated under some stronger assumptions which ensure pathwise uniqueness.},

Using entropy methods, we give sufficient conditions for the time marginals of the effective dynamics to be close to the original ones. We check numerically on some toy examples that these sufficient conditions yield an effective dynamics which accurately reproduces the residence times in the potential energy wells. We also discuss the accuracy of the effective dynamics in a pathwise sense, and the relevance of the free energy to build a coarse-grained dynamics.},

abstract = {Load balancing is a well-studied problem, with balls-in-bins being the primary framework. The greedy algorithm Greedy[d] of Azar et al. places each ball by probing d {\textgreater} 1 random bins and placing the ball in the least loaded of them. It ensures a maximum load that is exponentially better than the strategy of placing each ball uniformly at random. V¨ocking showed that a slightly asymmetric variant, Left[d], provides a further significant improvement. However, this improvement comes at an additional computational cost of imposing structure on the bins. Here, we present a fully decentralized and easy-to-implement algorithm called FirstDiff[d] that combines the simplicity of Greedy[d] and the improved balance of Left[d]. The key idea in FirstDiff[d] is to probe until a different bin size from the first observation is located, then place the ball. Although the number of probes could be quite large for some of the balls, we show that FirstDiff[d] requires only d probes on average per ball (in both the standard and the heavily-loaded settings). Thus the number of probes is no greater than either that of Greedy[d] or Left[d]. More importantly, we show that FirstDiff[d] closely matches the improved maximum load ensured by Left[d] in both the standard and heavily-loaded settings. We further provide a tight lower bound on the maximum load up to O(log log log n) terms. We additionally give experimental data that FirstDiff[d] is indeed as good as Left[d], if not better, in practice.},

abstract = {This paper studies the rate of convergence of a family of continuous-time Markov chains (CTMC) to a mean-field model. When the mean-field model is a finite-dimensional dynamical system with a unique equilibrium point, an analysis based on Stein's method and the perturbation theory shows that under some mild conditions, the stationary distributions of CTMCs converge (in the mean-square sense) to the equilibrium point of the mean-field model if the mean-field model is globally asymptotically stable and locally exponentially stable. In particular, the mean square difference between the Mth CTMC in the steady state and the equilibrium point of the mean-field system is O(1/M), where M is the size of the Mth CTMC. This approach based on Stein's method provides a new framework for studying the convergence of CTMCs to their mean-field limit by mainly looking into the stability of the meanfield model, which is a deterministic system and is often easier to analyze than the CTMCs. More importantly, this approach quantifies the rate of convergence, which reveals the approximation error of using mean-field models for approximating finite-size systems.},

abstract = {We establish a large deviation principle for the empirical measure process associated with a general class of finite-state mean field interacting particle systems with Lipschitz continuous transition rates that satisfy a certain ergodicity condition. The approach is based on a variational representation for functionals of a Poisson random measure. Under an appropriate strengthening of the ergodicity condition, we also prove a locally uniform large deviation principle. The main novelty is that more than one particle is allowed to change its state simultaneously, and so a standard approach to the proof based on a change of measure with respect to a system of independent particles is not possible. The result is shown to be applicable to a wide range of models arising from statistical physics, queueing systems and communication networks. Along the way, we establish a large deviation principle for a class of jump Markov processes on the simplex, whose rates decay to zero as they approach the boundary of the domain. This result may be of independent interest.},

@unpublished{MukBorLee17,
abstract = {We consider a system of N servers inter-connected by some underlying graph topol- ogy GN. Tasks arrive at the various servers as independent Poisson processes of rate $\lambda$. Each incoming task is irrevocably assigned to whichever server has the smallest number of tasks among the one where it appears and its neighbors in GN. Tasks have independent unit-mean exponentially distributed service times and leave the system upon service completion. The above model has been extensively investigated in the case GN is a clique. Since the servers are exchangeable in that case, the queue length process is quite tractable, and in particular it has been proved that for any $\lambda$ {\textless} 1, the fraction of servers with two or more tasks vanishes in the limit as N→∞. For an arbitrary graph GN, the lack of exchangeability severely complicates the analysis, and the queue length process tends to be worse than for a clique. Accordingly, a graph GN is said to be N-optimal or √N-optimal when the occupancy process on GN is equivalent to that on a clique on an N-scale or √N-scale, respectively. We prove that if GN is an Erd˝ os-R{\'{e}}nyi random graph with average degree d(N), then it is with high probability N-optimal and √N-optimal if d(N) → ∞ and d(N)/(√Nlog(N)) → ∞ √N-scale while reducing the number of connections by nearly a factor N and √N/ log(N) as N → ∞, respectively. This demonstrates that optimality can be maintained at N-scale and compared to a clique, provided the topology is suitably random. It is further shown that if GN contains $\Theta$(N) bounded-degree nodes, then it cannot be N-optimal. In addition, we establish that an arbitrary graph GN is N-optimal when itsminimum degree is N−o(N), and may not be N-optimal even when its minimum degree is cN+o(N) for any 0 {\textless} c {\textless} 1/2. 1},
